| Main Flow | Question: Which Class... | Answer  | Justification  |
|:--------------  |:---------------------- |:----------|:---------------------------- |
| 1. The Collaborator or the Manager initiates overview of statistics about task execution and freelancer payments.| ...interacts with the Collaborator or the Manager? | ShowOrganizationStatsUI  | Pure Fabrication, because it is not justified to assign this responsibility to any class that exists in the Domain Model. |
|                                             | ...coordinates the UC? |  ShowOrganizationStatsController | Controller |
| 2.The System confirms initiation and asks how he wants to sort the freelancers(name or payment value) .|...is responsible for calculating the mean and the standard deviation of delay for all freelancers? | Organization |By the application of the Information Expert it would be the Platform. But by applying HC + LC, the Platform delegates that responsibility to the Organization. |
|                                             |...knows Organization? | Platform | IE: According to the MD the Platform has registered Organization |
|                                             |...is responsible for calculating the mean and the standard deviation of payment for all freelancers? | Organization |By the application of the Information Expert it would be the Platform.

|                                             |...knows the delay in executing the task? | Execution | IE: has its own data  |
|                                             |...knows the class Execution? | Task | IE: According to the MD Task details Execution |
|                                             |...knows the value of the payment? | Transaction | IE: has its own data |
|                                             |...knows all payments made by an organization to a freelancer? | ListTransactions | By the application of the Information Expert it would be the Organization. But by applying HC + LC, the Organization delegates that responsibility to the ListTransactions. |

### Systematization ##

 From rational follow the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are:

 * Plataform
 * Freelancer
 * Organization
 * Task
 * Transaction
 * Execution



Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified:  

 * ShowOrganizationStatsUI
